##  Machine Learning Models Used
| Model | R¬≤ Score | RMSE |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Decision Tree Regressor | 0.30 | 54,498 |
| Random Forest Regressor | 0.34 | 52,961 |

The **Random Forest Regressor** performed slightly better than the Decision Tree model,  
indicating that ensemble methods improved the model‚Äôs predictive accuracy.
